What Are The Major Changes That Android Made To The Linux Kernel?
Robert Love, Software Engineer at Google

The interesting thing about Android’s design is how little we modified the kernel. Most embedded systems on which I have worked have made drastic changes to the kernel, only to leave user-space alone — for example, a heavily-modified “realtime” kernel but X11 for a GUI.

Android is the opposite: only minimal changes to the kernel, but a user-space wholly unlike that of any other Unix system. In fact, Android’s user-space is so different from stock Linux, you can easily say that Android is not in any way a Linux system, except for the kernel.

Here is a concise list of the changes we made to the Linux kernel:

ashmem (Android Shared Memory), a file-based shared memory system.
Binder, an inter-process communication (IPC) and remote procedure call (RPC) system.
logger, a high-speed in-kernel logging mechanism optimized for writes.
Paranoid Networking, a mechanism to restrict network I/O to certain processes.
pmem (Physical Memory), a driver for mapping large chunks of physical memory into user-space.
Viking Killer, a replacement OOM killer that implements Android’s “kill least recently used process” logic under low memory conditions.
wakelocks, Android’s unique power management solution, in which the default state of the device is sleep and explicit action is required (via a wakelock) to prevent that.
And, of course, the usual assortment of drivers, ARM architecture ports, and other associated low-level code necessary to support Android on any given device.


Of this list, nearly all of the bullets were implemented as device drivers with little or no changes necessary to core kernel code. The only significant subsystem-spanning change is wakelocks.
